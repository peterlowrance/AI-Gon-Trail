Summary:     The party must find a way to cross a river with a strong current and icy cold water.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to build a makeshift raft using the pots and pans, hammer, and rope to safely carry the party across the river', 'Use the wool coat and blankets to protect the party from the cold water as they attempt to cross on foot', 'Hunt for some fish and use the dried fruit, cheese, and tea to make a hot meal to warm up the party before they attempt to cross the river']
