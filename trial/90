Scenario 1
Scenario:    The party encounters a river that has recently flooded, making it impossible to cross. The waters are too strong to wade through and the current is too fast to attempt to swim across.
Summary:     The party must find a way to cross a flooded river.
Suggestions: ['Try to find a shallow area of the river to cross on foot, potentially risking getting swept away by the current.', 'Scavenge for materials to build a makeshift bridge or raft to cross the river.', 'Search for a nearby settlement or campsite to potentially trade for a way to cross the river or to find a guide who knows of a safer crossing point.']
Player action Try to find a shallow area of the river to cross on foot, potentially risking getting swept away by the current.
