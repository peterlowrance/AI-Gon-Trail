Summary:     The party faces a dangerous river that blocks their path to the west.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to build a raft using the available materials and float across the river', 'Search for a safer crossing point upstream or downstream', 'Hire a local guide who knows the area and can help the party cross the river safely']
