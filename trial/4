Scenario 1
Scenario:    As the party travels, they come across a large river that has flooded its banks, making it impossible to cross by wagon. The water is moving fast and there are no bridges in sight. The party must find a way to safely cross the river in order to continue their journey westward.
Summary:     The party must safely cross a flooded river with no bridges in sight.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to ford the river with the wagon, but only if the water is not too deep and the current is not too strong.', 'Build a makeshift raft using the wagon cover and other items, but make sure to test it before attempting to cross.', 'Look for a ferry service or a friendly local who can help them safely cross the river.']
Player action Attempt to ford the river with the wagon, but only if the water is not too deep and the current is not too strong.
