Scenario 1
Scenario:    As the party travels through the dense forest, they come across a river that has flooded its banks due to a heavy rainstorm. The water is too deep and rapid to ford, and the only bridge has been washed away. They must find a way to cross the river and continue their journey.
Summary:     The party must find a way to cross a flooded river.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to build a makeshift raft or boat to ferry the party and their supplies across the river.', 'Look for a shallower area of the river where they may be able to wade across with the help of ropes and other equipment.', 'Scour the area for a new route, possibly leading them away from their intended path but avoiding the dangerous river crossing.']
Player action Attempt to build a makeshift raft or boat to ferry the party and their supplies across the river.
