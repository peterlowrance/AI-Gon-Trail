Scenario 1
Scenario:    As the party continues their journey, they come across a large river that has flooded due to heavy rains. The water is too deep to ford, and the only way across is a narrow, rickety bridge that looks like it could collapse at any moment.
Summary:     The party must cross a dangerous bridge over a flooded river on their journey west.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to reinforce the bridge with available materials such as the hammer and nails.', 'Scout ahead to look for an alternate crossing point or a safer path through the water.', 'Use the compass and map to try and find a different route that avoids the river altogether.']
Player action Attempt to reinforce the bridge with available materials such as the hammer and nails.
