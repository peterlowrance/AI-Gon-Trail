Scenario 1
Scenario:    As the party travels through a dense forest, they come across a river that has flooded its banks, making it impossible to cross without risking their lives. The water is fast-moving and the currents are strong, making it a dangerous situation for the party.
Summary:     The party encounters a flooded river that prevents them from crossing.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to build a makeshift raft using items such as the hammer, knife, and pots and pans to cross the river safely.', 'Search for a shallow point in the river where they can safely wade across while holding on to each other.', 'Wait for the water to recede before attempting to cross the river, using the time to hunt for food and replenish supplies.']
