Scenario 1
Scenario:    The party comes across a river that has flooded its banks, making it impossible to cross without risking their lives. The water is murky and it's unclear how deep it is or what is lurking beneath the surface.
Summary:     The party must find a safe way to cross the flooded river to continue their journey west.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to find a shallow point in the river to cross, using a long stick to check the depth and stability of the riverbed.', 'Build a raft or makeshift boat using the saw and wagon cover, and attempt to cross the river that way.', 'Wait for the water to recede or try to find an alternate route around the river, which may add extra time and distance to the journey.']
Player action Attempt to find a shallow point in the river to cross, using a long stick to check the depth and stability of the riverbed.
