Scenario 1
Scenario:    As the party continues on their journey, they come across a raging river that they must cross in order to continue. The water is too deep to wade across and the current is too strong to attempt to swim across. To make matters worse, the only bridge in the area has been washed away by a recent storm.
Summary:     The party must find a way to safely cross a raging river with no bridge.
Suggestions: ['Attempt to construct a makeshift raft or boat to cross the river', 'Search for a shallow area of the river to ford through', 'Attempt to find a local guide who knows a safe route across the river']
Player action Attempt to construct a makeshift raft or boat to cross the river
